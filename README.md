The goal of this project, part of the Deep Learning Udacity Nanodegree, is to generate Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. 

The project will make us of Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
